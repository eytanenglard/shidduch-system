  about: 'An optimist who loves deep conversations over coffee. I find beauty in life\'s small things, whether it\'s a walk in nature or a good playlist. After a few attempts that didn\'t work out, I now know better what\'s right for me, and I\'m looking for a partner for the journey, to build a home together filled with laughter, mutual respect, and shared growth.',

I'm very creative, which is expressed in my work and hobbies, and I have good listening skills - friends say I'm 'receptive'. I value deep conversations, but I also love to laugh and enjoy the simple things.",
    personality_good_vs_perfect_day: "A 'perfect' day is a big thing, but a 'really good' day is built from many small things: a good phone call with my mom, a creative breakthrough at work on a design I've been working hard on, a spontaneous trip to the beach at sunset, and ending the day with a good conversation and a cup of tea. It's a feeling of satisfaction and peace.",

I am not shomer negiah, but I believe in creating an initial connection based on getting to know the personality before the physical aspect. My approach is "inner self reflected on the outside".',
    religion_children_education_religious_vision_revised: 'My vision is to establish a home where children grow up with values of giving, love of Torah, and the Land of Israel. It is important to me that the education be open and allow for questioning, one that nurtures thinking individuals with a deep, internal reverence for God.',

I seek constant growth, both in my career and personal life.",
