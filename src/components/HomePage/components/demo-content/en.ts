  about: 'An optimist who loves deep conversations over coffee. I find beauty in life\'s small things, whether it\'s a walk in nature or a good playlist.

    // Personality World
    personality_self_portrayal_revised: "I'm an optimistic and positive person who believes you can find the good in any situation. I'm very creative, which is expressed in my work and hobbies, and I have good listening skills - friends say I'm 'receptive'. I value deep conversations, but I also love to laugh and enjoy the simple things.",
    personality_good_vs_perfect_day: "A 'perfect' day is a big thing, but a 'really good' day is built from many small things: a good phone call with my mom, a creative breakthrough at work on a design I've been working hard on, a spontaneous trip to the beach at sunset, and ending the day with a good conversation and a cup of tea. It's a feeling of satisfaction and peace.",
    personality_failure_lesson: "From a failure in a big project at work, I learned that my value isn't dependent on external success and that it's important to ask for help. It taught me a lot about self-compassion and teamwork.",

    // Values World
    values_core_elaboration_revised: "The most important value to me is mutual respect. At a professional crossroads, I could have taken a big project at a colleague's expense, but I chose to collaborate. Although I earned less personal 'credit', we built something better together and maintained a healthy relationship. It was proof to myself that the journey is just as important as the destination.",
    values_strength_from_challenge: "I grew up in a very creative but also somewhat chaotic home. It taught me from a young age to find order and quiet within myself, and it developed in me a very high capacity for empathy and sensitivity to my surroundings. The challenge turned me into someone who understands people deeply.",
    
    // Relationship World
    relationship_household_philosophy: "I believe in a full and flexible partnership, like I saw in my parents' home, where my dad is in finance and my mom is an artist, and each brings their strengths. Not fixed 'roles', but a team that works together according to strengths and available time. It's all about open communication.",
    relationship_deal_breaker_summary_final_revised: "The one thing a relationship cannot survive without for me is open and honest communication. My greatest hope is to build a home filled with laughter, mutual respect, and shared growth.",

    // Partner World
    partner_deal_breakers_open_text_revised: 'My absolute red line is condescending cynicism and a basic lack of respect for people (for example, how he talks to a waiter). I cannot be with someone who doesn\'t know how to respect every person for who they are.',
    partner_must_have_quality_final_revised: "The one quality upon which everything rests is kindness. A person with a good heart is someone who knows how to give, receive, forgive, and be a true partner. Everything else is built on this foundation.",
    
    // Religion World
    religion_modesty_personal_approach_revised: 'My modesty is mainly expressed in choosing respectful attire (I wear both pants and skirts) and clean speech. I am not shomer negiah, but I believe in creating an initial connection based on getting to know the personality before the physical aspect. My approach is "inner self reflected on the outside".',
    religion_children_education_religious_vision_revised: 'My vision is to establish a home where children grow up with values of giving, love of Torah, and the Land of Israel. It is important to me that the education be open and allow for questioning, one that nurtures thinking individuals with a deep, internal reverence for God.',

    personality_self_portrayal_revised: "I'm a man of action, I love challenges and goals. Reliability is very important to me, and I always try to stand by my word. I have a strong analytical side, which I got from my studies at Yeshivat HaGush and in engineering, but I balance it with a creative side - I love playing the guitar and connect deeply with the world of Hasidut. I seek constant growth, both in my career and personal life.",
    personality_strengths_and_weaknesses_revised: "Two of my strong traits are ambition and reliability. I set high goals for myself and work hard to achieve them, and I believe my word can be trusted. The area I'm working on is emotional openness. Because of my analytical side, it sometimes takes me time to process and share feelings, and I'm trying to be more open and emotionally accessible.",

    // Values World
    values_core_elaboration_revised: "My central value is responsibility. When I served as an officer in the Combat Engineering Corps, I had to make a complex operational decision under pressure. I chose the safer course of action, even though it was less 'glamorous'. It was a decision based on responsibility for the lives of my soldiers, and it reinforced my understanding that integrity and responsibility are above all else.",

    relationship_household_philosophy: "I believe in a division based on strengths and efficiency, with transparency and coordination. If one partner is better at cooking and the other at managing finances, it makes sense for each to lead in their area, but both should be involved and supportive. The goal is for the home to function as the best possible team.",
    relationship_deal_breaker_summary_final_revised: "The absolute deal-breaker is a lack of integrity. The greatest aspiration is a true partnership. The knowledge that I have someone by my side, that we are a team against whatever life brings, and that we always look out for each other.",

    // Partner World
    partner_completion_trait: "As someone who is used to planning and acting in a very structured way, I would be happy to find someone with more spontaneity and flow, someone who will help me get out of the box sometimes and bring some adventure into life.",
    partner_deal_breakers_open_text_revised: "A red line for me is a lack of ambition to develop and improve. I'm not looking for someone perfect, but it's important to me that she has an internal motivation to grow, learn, and be a better version of herself. Passivity and an unwillingness to face challenges is something I find very difficult to connect with.",
